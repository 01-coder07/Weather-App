## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a city name
2. App sends a request to OpenWeather API using `fetch()`
3. Shows loading spinner while data is being fetched
4. Displays weather details on success
5. Shows an error message if city is not found or API fails

* Working with **REST APIs**
* Using **async / await** with proper error handling
* Managing **UI states** (loading, success, error)
* Improving UX with animations and visual feedback
* Structuring a frontend project cleanly
